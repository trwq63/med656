The AccountController will offer a Edit(model) procedure. This procedure will interact with the Database object. When the Edit() procedure is called, the AccountController will get the username by using the Microsoft provided attribute User.Identity.Name. The AccountController will then call the Database's UserProfiles.FirstOrDefault(Username). This procedure will respond with the UserProfile corresponding to the Username. The AccountController will then set all the UserProfile attributes to the values provided in the model that was passed in with the Edit(model) call. Then the AccountController will set the Database's Entry(UserProfile).State to EntityState.Modified and call the Database's SaveChanges() procedure. The AccountController can then redirect the User to the Home page again.
