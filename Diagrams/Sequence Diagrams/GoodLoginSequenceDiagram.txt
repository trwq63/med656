The AccountController will offer a Login() procedure. It will interact with the Microsoft provided UserManager and SignInManager objects. When the Login is called it will call the UserManager's FindByName(Username) procedure to make sure the user exists in the database. Then the Login() procedure will call the SignInManager's PasswordSignIn(Username,Password,RememberMe) procedure. This will return a SignInStatus that tells the AccountController if the signin was successful. If the signin was successful, the AccountController will redirect the user to the retURL.
