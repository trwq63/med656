The AccountController will provide a Register(model) procedure. The AccountController will create a new ApplicationUser when the Register() procedure is called. Then the AccountController will then call the Microsoft provided UserManager's Create(ApplicationUser,Password) procedure. This procedure will return a Success if the creation was successful. If a Success is returned, the AccountController will redirect the user back to the Home page.
