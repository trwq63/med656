Once you have filled this out with the appropriate information and selected the "Physician" radio button at the top,
you are ready to submit your request. When you click submit you should be brought to a confirmation page.

You will not be able to login though until a system admin has approved your account.

Experiment Admin Account
------------------------

Experiment Admin accounts are created the same way as the physician accounts. Just make sure to select the "Experiment Administrator"
radio button at the top of the request account page instead of the "Physician" radio button.

Patient Account

Patient accounts can only be created by their physician. From the physician account's home page click the "CREATE PATIENT"
button at the top right of the screen.

System Admin Account
--------------------

UAHFitVault comes with a system administrator pre-configured. The username is 'fitadmin' and the password is 'Password1!'.
We recommend changing this after the installation before the server is made publicly available.

New System Admin accounts can be created by other System Admin accounts. From the System Admin account home page, click
the "Create Admin" button at the top right corner of the screen.

.. image:: ./images/account_approval.png

You will be presented with a form to fill out for the system admin account information.

Once the form is filled out and you click the create button, you should get a confirmation page.
